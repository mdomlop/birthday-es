# Birthday-es

Translated to spanish version of Birthday.

`birthday` is a little program wich originally wrote Andy Mortimer 
<andy.mortimer@zetnet.co.uk> when he was learning C. 

It displays a list of events which are coming up in the near future,
based on a config file (`~/.birthdays`) in the user's home directory.  
If you include it in your .profile, you will get the list every time 
you log on.  See the manpage for more details of this format.

You can download the latest version from the SourceForge project page,
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/birthday/> .

The source as supplied includes a version for Windows.  This version
uses the Borland custom controls (as shipped with BC++ 3.1), and a DLL
which Andy wrotes which had prettier buttons, which is not supplied here
(as it never really worked!).  Therefore it most likely will not
compile as is, but is included for reference.  Andy don't uses Windows
much any more, so if you fix it up and get it working, it'd be nice if
you could send him the new version for the use of everyone else.
